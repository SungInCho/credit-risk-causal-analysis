# Credit Risk Causal Analysis
### Does a Higher Interest Rate Cause Default? — A Causal Inference Study on Lending Club Loans

---

## Research Questions

1. **Main**: Among observationally similar approved Lending Club borrowers, how much does a higher interest rate *increase* the probability of default?
2. **Extension**: How does risk-based pricing affect default, and for which borrowers is this effect largest?

---

## Key Finding

Being assigned an **above-median interest rate within one's grade** increases the probability of default by approximately **2–5 percentage points**, after controlling for observable borrower characteristics. This effect is largest for high-DTI, low-FICO borrowers.

The naive (unadjusted) rate–default correlation overstates the causal effect by **50–80%** due to grade-level confounding — the core endogeneity problem this project addresses.

## Identification Strategy

**Treatment**: `high_rate` — a loan is treated if its interest rate exceeds the **grade-level median**.

**Why within-grade?**
Grade assignment captures the broad credit-quality confound. Conditional on grade and observable borrower characteristics (FICO, DTI, income, etc.), the residual within-grade rate variation is plausibly quasi-random — driven by pricing discretion and minor scoring differences rather than hard credit-quality differences.

**Causal methods used**:

| Method | Treatment type | Key assumption |
|---|---|---|
| IPW (Horvitz–Thompson) | Binary `high_rate` | Propensity score correctly specified |
| AIPW (doubly robust) | Binary `high_rate` | Either PS model or outcome model correct |
| DML (partially linear) | Continuous `int_rate` | Partially linear structural equation |
| Causal Forest | Binary `high_rate` | Conditional unconfoundedness |
| Sub-grade boundary Wald | Continuous `int_rate` | Rate jump at grade boundary is exogenous |

## Robustness Checks

1. **36-month loans only** — cleaner maturity horizon
2. **2014–2015 vintage only** — homogeneous market conditions
3. **Purpose subsamples** — debt consolidation vs. others
4. **'Current' loans included** — lower-bound default rate assumption
5. **High-rate threshold sensitivity** — 25th to 75th percentile cutoffs

---

## Selection Bias Caveat

All causal estimates apply to the **approved Lending Club sample**. Rejected applicants have lower FICO scores, higher DTI, and smaller loan amounts. The population-level effect of risk-based pricing is likely **larger** than within-sample estimates suggest.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and set up environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/credit-risk-causal-analysis.git
cd credit-risk-causal-analysis
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download data

See [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) for download instructions. Place the two CSV files in `data/raw/`.

### 3. Run notebooks in order

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Open notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory and run them sequentially: `01` → `02` → `03` → `04` → `05`.

Each notebook reads its input from `outputs/intermediate/` and writes outputs back there or to `outputs/figures/`.
